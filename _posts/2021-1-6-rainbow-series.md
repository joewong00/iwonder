>At the end of the rainbow, you will find true meaning of life. 

Have you ever wondered what brings the combination of colours to the sky when the sun shines after the rainfall? Let's talk about one of the most stunning natural phenomenon: rainbow!

## Part 1: Formation

Have you ever wondered how a rainbow is formed? Why do we always see it only **after** the rain? Why do we only see an arc of the rainbow? 

First of all, a rainbow's shape is **not** actually an arc, but instead a **full circle**. We always see an arc because we only see the **upper half** of the rainbow at certain angle, and the lower half is hidden **below** the [horizon](#keywords) when we are standing on the ground. If you're on a plane, at the right angle, you can see a full circle rainbow! 

Now how does it form? It is again, a natural phenomenon of **light**. When there are droplets of water in the air (especially after the rain), sunlight from behind you enters the droplet and get [refracted](#keywords) twice, and [reflected](#keywords) back to your eyes. Refraction of light causes the **bending** of light and each of the wavelength(colors) of the light is bent at a different rate, causing the wavelength to be separated when the light exits the droplet. 

The rainbow you see is unique to you, because the spectrum of colors will only be visible to you from a very specific angle relative to where you are (approx `40°` ~ `42°`). That's why when you move forward, the rainbow seems to recede away from you, and the rainbow is simply coming out from a different raindrop.

## Part 2: Colour

>ROYGBIV..?

Have you ever wondered what is the **true** colour of a rainbow? We all know it composed of 7 colours: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, or `ROYGBIV` for short. We can recreate rainbow light by using a glass prism at the right angle. As white light move through the prism, different colours of the light bend different amounts ([refraction](#keywords)), it spreads out into a rainbow.. but look closely. ([pic](#image2))

The rainbow colour it produces is not quite `ROYGBIV`, like where is the **violet** light? And there is some “light blue” colour between blue and green, or what we call **cyan**, why isn’t this colour in `ROYGBIV`? That brings is back the origin of `ROYGBIV`, when Sir [Isaac Newton](#keywords) did an experiment with light and labelled the colour observed `ROYGBIV`. The thing he called “Blue” was indeed what we would now call **cyan**, and what we now tend to call blue, Newton called it “Violet”, as in `roses are red, violets are blue`.

**Purple**, **magenta** or **pink** as we know today **don’t occur** in the rainbow from a prism because they can only be formed as a combination of red and blue light, which, are in **opposite** sides of the rainbow, nowhere near overlapping, so there are **no** purple or pink in the rainbow. Violets are there, but is actually now what we call blue. But here’s the thing, sometimes we do see **purple** (and/or pink) in the rainbows in the sky. Why is that?

In [part 1](#part-1-formation), we know rainbow is really a round disk. Because light is a **wave**, [interference](#keywords) occurs within the raindrops as the light [refract](#keywords), causing it to produce multiple rings, the outermost rings (brightest) is the **primary ring**, while the rest is called **supernumerary rings** (ring within ring) or supernumerary rainbow. At the right size of the raindrop, the first red supernumerary ring overlaps with the blue/violet primary ring, so red + violet gives us purple!

Roses are red, violets are blue, and purple is just a supernumerary hue.

### Fun Facts
[Newton](#keywords) added the colour "**Indigo**" for his "fundamental 7 colours of the rainbow" just to match the number of notes in the muscial scale `"do re mi fa so la ti"`

## Keywords
- **Horizon**: The line at which the earth's surface and the sky appear to meet.

- **Refraction**: Refraction is the bending of light (it also happens with sound, water and other waves) as it passes from one transparent substance into another. This bending by refraction makes it possible for us to have lenses, magnifying glasses, prisms and rainbows.

- **Reflection**: Reflection is when light bounces off an object. If the surface is smooth and shiny, like glass, water or polished metal, the light will reflect at the same angle as it hit the surface. For a smooth surface, reflected light rays travel in the same direction.

- **Isaac Newton**: Sir Isaac Newton PRS was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author widely recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians and physicists of all time and among the most influential scientists. Sir Isaac Newton PRS was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author widely recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians and physicists of all time and among the most influential scientists. 

- **Interference**: Interference of light is a common phenomenon that can be explained classically by the superposition or overlapping of the light waves.
