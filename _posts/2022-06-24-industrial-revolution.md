## Part 1: The First Industrial Revolution

In the 19th century, the industrial revolution was mainly confined to Great Britain. The first industrial revolution was important to mark the era of mechanisation. Before the industrial revolution, most of the world's population engaged in farming. However, it was realised that the use of machine and new energy source were needed to increase the production.

The first industrial revolution started when a new source of energy was found, steam. The first ever atmospheric steam engine was built that can be used to pump water from mines. Then, steam engines improved rapidly over the century, and were put into use for more power demanding applications, such as coalmines, textile mills and dozens of other heavy industries.

Coal as one of the essential raw materials for many industries, there were more incentive to get more coal using steam engines in order to keep the coal mining cost cheap and time efficient. With cheap coals, it created the opportunity for everything from railroads and steels, so that mines transport was much more effective.

The use of steam as energy source became one of the most important advancements that shaped the first industrial revolution in the 19th century, but also acted as a stepping stone for something more powerful..
