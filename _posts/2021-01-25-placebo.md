>Belief is the key to success

Have you ever wondered can our power of belief change our body **physically**? A placebo is something that shouldn't work, but due to our **power of belief**, does! In medical field, placebo can have a powerful influence on the body, in some cases can even help the body **heals**. How?

In `1996`, `56` volunteers took part in a study to test a new **painkiller**. One of the subject's index finger is covered with this painkiller while the other index finger is remained untouched. Then both index fingers were squeezed with painful clamps. The subject then reported that the treated finger **hurt less** than the untreated one. That's one effective painkiller there right? Except it's not actually a painkiller, but a fake mixture with **no pain easing properties** at all.   
  
The answer lies within the **placebo effect**, an **unexplained** phenomenon wherein **fake drugs** or treatment that aren't suppose to have an effect, but miraculously make people feel better, just because the subjects **did not know** it was fake, thus **believing** the painkiller had some effects. The more serious and potent the 'fake' treatment looks, the more effective it becomes, thanks to the power of the brain.  
  
If you're reading this, you might think that the more you learn about placebos, and your lack of intrinsic power, the less effective they become right? No. Studies show that even if subjects know their treatment is a placebo, there will **still be a positive effect** and result. A placebo can't fix everything, but one always has the power to start healing, if one believes in it. So always be positive about yourself!
