>Twinkle twinkle little stars... really, how little can they be?

Have you ever wondered how stars are formed? Why do they "twinkle"? There are estimated 100-400 **billion** stars in our galaxy alone. Stars size vary, some can be even few thousand times larger than our sun!

## Part 1: Formation
First off, what are **stars**? Stars are celestial bodies that can produce light and heat. (Eg. the nearest star to earth - the **sun**). How do these stars form in the vast space of the universe?

At first, there was nothing but **cloud of gas and dust** in the universe, consisting mostly **hydrogen** gas. When the cloud reaches a critical amount,Â  **gravity** comes into play. (Mass attracts one another, discussed in [this post]({% post_url 2021-1-14-round-earth %})). These gases collapse into a ball under their own gravity, creating what's known as the [protostar](#keywords). When the temperature and density become high enough, hydrogen atoms are **fused** to form **helium**, releasing tremendous amount of energy, heat and light. This process is called [nuclear fusion](#keywords).

The energy released in the form of **radiation**, pushes against the gravity. A delicate **balance** is made between these 2 forces as long there are fusion in the core, `a star is born` and can remain stable for at least few hundred thousand to billions of years depends on its size. 

For different surface temperature, stars have different **colors** (Red being the coolest and blue being the hottest!)

## Part 2: Death of Stars
> Everything has to come to an end.. sometime
  
When you look up the sky and see the beautiful stars, have you ever wondered do they have **lifespan**? How long will the flicker last and more interestingly, what happened after they die? 
  
Sadly yes, as I mentioned in last part that a star undergoes [nuclear fusion](#keywords), that is causing **hydrogen** to be fused together to form **helium**. Some larger stars can form even heavier element like **carbon** and **oxygen**, and eventually **iron** due to extreme pressure and temperature. So when the hydrogen fuel runs out, the fusion cannot be done, the balance between radiation and gravity broke down, the core **collapses**.   
  
For an **average** sized star (like the sun), the star then grows rapidly (**red giant**) and the last burst of energy ejects its outer layer in a [planetary nebula](#keywords), leaving a hot, dense core that eventually cools down, a **white dwarf**.   
  
Things got interesting for more **massive** stars. As the core collapses, the gravity is so strong that it feeds more mass into the core, triggering what's called a [supernova](#keywords) explosion, releasing all the element into the space. This then leaves a superdense core, of what we called a **neutron star**. Or if the gravity is strong enough, the core itself collapses to form a **black hole**, which is discussed in [this post]({% post_url 2021-1-14-round-earth %}).

## Keywords
- **Protostar**: A protostar is a very young star that is still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud. The protostellar phase is the earliest one in the process of stellar evolution. For a low-mass star (i.e. that of the Sun or lower), it lasts about 500,000 years.

- **Nuclear Fusion**: In a fusion reaction, **two light nuclei merge to form a single heavier nucleus**. The process releases energy because the total mass of the resulting single nucleus is less than the mass of the two original nuclei. The leftover mass becomes energy.

- **Planetary Nebula**: A planetary nebula is **created when a star blows off its outer layers after it has run out of fuel to burn**. These outer layers of gas expand into space, forming a nebula which is often the shape of a ring or bubble.

- **Supernova**: A supernova is a powerful and luminous stellar explosion. This transient astronomical event occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star
